    "Cross-validation is a method for squeezing the most value out of your dataset. Typically, when we spilt our dataset into train and test sets, we do so randomly. By chance, it may be that your training data is an especially good (or bad) representation of the true data. There is really no way to split the data into optimal training and test sets.<P>\n",

    "This is where cross-validation helps improve the evaluation of our model. Technically, cross-validation is a resampling method that uses different portions of the data to test and train a model on different iterations. It is mainly used in settings where the goal is prediction, and one wants to estimate how accurately a predictive model will perform.\n",
