    "A Jupyter notebook consists of cells. The two main types of cells you will use are code cells and markdown cells. First, an overview.\n",
    "\n",
    "A code cell contains actual code that you want to run. You can specify a cell as a code cell using the pulldown menu in the toolbar of your Jupyter notebook. Otherwise, you can can hit Esc and then y (denoted Esc - y‚Äù) while a cell is selected to specify that it is a code cell. Note that you will have to hit enter after doing this to start editing it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to execute the code in a code cell, hit Enter while holding down the Shift key (denoted Shift + Enter). Note that code cells are executed in the order you shift-enter them. That is to say, the ordering of the cells for which you hit Shift + Enter is the order in which the code is executed. If you did not explicitly execute a cell early in the document, its results are not known to the Python interpreter. This is a very important point and is often a source of confusion and frustration for students.\n",
    "\n",
    "Markdown cells contain text. The text is written in markdown, a lightweight markup language. As you are typing the contents of these cells, the results appear as text. Hitting Shift + Enter renders the text in the formatting you specify.\n",

    "Markdown formatting reference: https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/db2-event-store/2.0.0?topic=notebooks-markdown-jupyter-cheatsheet\n",

    "You can specify a cell as being a markdown cell in the Jupyter toolbar, or by hitting Esc - m in the cell. Again, you have to hit enter after using the quick keys to bring the cell into edit mode.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, when you want to add a new cell, you can click the + icon on the notebook toolbar. The shortcut to insert a cell below is Esc - b and to insert a cell above is Esc - a. Alternatively, you can execute a cell and automatically add a new one below it by hitting Alt + Enter.\n"
